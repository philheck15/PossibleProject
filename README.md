# PossibleProject
An Ecommerce platform wireframes for the Possible Project.

The possible project was to be an ecommerce platform built for kids at risk of dropping out in the Cambridge school system. The idea was that they would have access to an ecommerce platform while still in school where they could make money selling wares or services that they made or provided. In order to be effective it needed a client facing platform as well as a private section that was to be monitored by a responsible adult who would be supervising and monitoring the kids interactions on a weekly basis in order to keep things smooth sailing.
